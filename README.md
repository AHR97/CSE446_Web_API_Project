# CSE446 Web API Project


## Introduction
An e-commerce site’s primary goal is to sell goods and services online. Online
shopping is a type of electronic shopping store in which the buyer connects
directly to the seller’s computer, typically via the internet. The transaction is
completed electronically and interactively in real time.
The proposed system aids in the development of a website for the purchase
and sale of products or goods over the internet.Unlike traditional commerce,
which requires a person to go out and get products, eCommerce has made it
easier for humans to reduce physical work and save time.The application’s basic
concept is to allow customers to shop virtually using the Internet and purchase
items.
We tired to implement all the functionality and features of our requirement
to our best of understanding.We have build a modern eCommerce site where
interaction happens between 3 parties via API calls. These parties are the client,
suppliers of the eCommerce stie and the bank where all the monitory asset are
